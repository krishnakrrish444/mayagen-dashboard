## 7. Distribution Strategy

### Owned Channels
- **Blog** (mayagen.ai/blog) — primary SEO hub
- **Email list** — nurture + announce
- **Social media** (Twitter/X, LinkedIn, Instagram, YouTube)
- **In-app notifications** — surface tutorials to users at relevant moments

### Earned Channels
- **Product Hunt** launch (time with a major feature release)
- **Guest posts** on design/tech blogs (Smashing Magazine, Creative Bloq, Towards Data Science)
- **Podcast appearances** — AI/design/startup podcasts
- **Community seeding** — Reddit (r/artificial, r/graphic_design, r/midjourney), Designer News, Hacker News
- **Influencer/creator partnerships** — send free Pro accounts to design YouTubers and AI art creators

### Paid Channels (when budget allows)
- **Google Ads** — target high-intent keywords ("ai design tool," "ai image generator")
- **Twitter/X promoted posts** — amplify best-performing organic content
- **Sponsorships** — AI/design newsletters (TLDR, The Rundown AI, Dense Discovery)

### SEO Strategy
- Target long-tail keywords first (lower competition, higher intent)
- Build topical clusters around each content pillar
- Internal linking between blog posts within the same cluster
- Update and republish top-performing posts quarterly
- Target featured snippets with structured how-to content

### Content Repurposing Flywheel
```
Blog Post → Twitter thread → LinkedIn post → Instagram carousel → YouTube short → Email excerpt → Podcast talking point
```
Every long-form blog post should produce 5–7 derivative pieces across channels.
