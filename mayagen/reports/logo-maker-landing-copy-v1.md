# Logo Designer – Landing Page Copy v1 (Suite-First, Multilingual)

_Last updated: 2026-02-13_

This draft combines Product Strategy v2, Content & Messaging v2, and the UX review for Logo Maker. It positions Logo Designer as the **entry point to a brand system and launch flow**, not a standalone logo tool.

## 1. Above the Fold

**Page title (H1)**  
Logo Designer – Design your brand, then roll it out everywhere.

Mayagen connects your new logo to templates, brand kits, and a social calendar so you can go from “no logo” to a fully scheduled launch in under 30 minutes.

**Primary CTA**  
`Design your logo & launch kit`

**Secondary CTA**  
`See logo-to-launch flow` (scrolls to the flow strip below)

## 2. Flow Strip – From Logo to Launch in One Guided Flow

**Section heading (H2)**  
From logo concept to scheduled launch, in one flow

**Intro copy**  
Most logo tools stop at a file download. Logo Designer walks you through a guided flow:

> New logo → Brand Kit → Templates → Scheduled launch posts

**Step cards (H3 + body)**

1. **Design your logo**  
   Describe your name, industry, and style. Explore AI-powered logo directions with guided feedback instead of random noise.

2. **Auto-build your brand kit**  
   Turn your chosen logo into a living brand kit—colors, fonts, and usage rules that apply automatically across Meme Generator, Product Mockups, and social templates.

3. **Generate launch-ready assets**  
   One click to spin up profile photos, cover images, announcement graphics, and promo templates that inherit your new brand.

4. **Schedule your launch across channels**  
   Drop your launch posts straight onto the Mayagen calendar, with suggested times and variants for each platform and language.

Inline label suggestions:
- Badge: "Brand Kit included"
- Badge: "Planner + scheduler built in"

## 3. Value Section – Your Logo Is the Start of a Brand System

**Section heading (H2)**  
Your logo is the start of a brand system, not the end

**Intro copy**  
A logo on its own is just a file. In Mayagen, your logo becomes the control center for consistent, multilingual content across every channel.

**Three-column value blocks (H3 + bullets)**

### Explore & decide faster
- Get structured directions based on your name, values, and industry.
- Preview how each concept looks on social profiles, covers, and posts before you commit.
- Compare dark/light variants and layout options side by side.

### Auto-brand everything
- Save your chosen logo as a Brand Kit with one click.
- Apply your kit automatically to memes, mockups, carousels, and campaign templates.
- Keep colors, typography, and logo usage consistent without manual policing.

### Launch in days, not months
- Generate a launch graphics kit: announcement, countdown, and "now live" posts.
- Schedule your first week of launch content in a single calendar view.
- Reuse your launch kit for promos, product drops, and seasonal campaigns.

## 4. Multilingual Branding & Launch

**Section heading (H2)**  
Launch your brand in every market at once

**Intro copy**  
Nano Banana Pro makes multilingual branding feel native, not translated. Logo Designer helps you explore names, taglines, and launch assets for every region you care about.

**Key bullets**
- Explore name and tagline directions in multiple languages while keeping visuals consistent.
- Generate logo lockups and taglines per market—English, Spanish, Hindi, and more—from a single brand kit.
- Create localized launch posts (captions + visuals) for each language and schedule them together on the same calendar.
- Review all language variants side by side before you publish.

Optional UI note for design:
- Tabs for languages (EN, ES, FR, HI, etc.) with previews of logo lockups and launch posts.

## 5. How Logo Designer Fits Into the Mayagen Suite

**Section heading (H2)**  
Built into your visual & social command center

**Short narrative**  
Logo Designer is the starting point for your brand inside Mayagen:

1. Start in Logo Designer to define your visual identity.
2. Mayagen turns it into a Brand Kit that powers Meme Generator, Product Mockups, and social templates.
3. Planner and Scheduler help you roll out a coordinated launch across platforms and languages.

**Bulleted highlights**
- One brand kit that powers every graphic tool in Mayagen.
- Templates for memes, promos, and product shots that stay on-brand by default.
- A shared calendar where every post, in every language, pulls from the same brand system.

Suggested visual: simple diagram with `Logo Designer` → `Brand Kit` → `Templates` → `Planner & Scheduler`.

## 6. Social Proof & Time-to-Launch Story

**Section heading (H2)**  
From "no logo" to launch week in under 30 minutes

**Testimonial-style block (placeholder)**  
> "We went from a blank page to a logo, brand kit, and a full week of launch posts in one afternoon. I didnt open a single design file."  
>  Small business owner (cafe / salon / ecommerce  to be replaced with real quote)

**Metric-oriented microcopy**
- Typical new brands ship their first week of posts in under 30 minutes after choosing a logo.
- Teams reuse the same launch kit for future promos, saving hours on every campaign.

## 8. Notes for Design & Implementation

- The flow strip should visually mirror the core product journey: **Logo → Brand Kit → Templates → Calendar**.
- Ensure CTAs like "Design your logo & launch kit" and "Open in Planner" map to real in-product routes into the brand kit setup and calendar views.
- Tie multilingual elements to shared language settings so Logo Designer, templates, and scheduler stay in sync.
- Consider reusing layout patterns from the Meme Generator landing page so tool pages feel like a family, with clear emphasis on the suite: **create → plan → schedule**.
