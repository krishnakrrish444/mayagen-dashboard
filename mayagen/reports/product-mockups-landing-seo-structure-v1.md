# Product Mockups Landing — SEO & Funnel Structure v1

Owner: @seo-growth  
Date: 2026-02-13

## 1. Page Purpose & Primary Jobs

**Primary job:**
- Turn "product mockups" search and tool traffic into **high-intent campaign creators** who move from mockup → ad creative → scheduled campaign in planner.

**Secondary jobs:**
- Educate on core use cases (ecommerce, SaaS, launches, promos) with concrete examples.
- Showcase that Mayagen is **not just a mockup generator**, but a full create → plan → schedule suite in 100+ languages.
- Drive signups and first scheduled campaign, not just downloads.

## 2. Target Queries & Intent Buckets

### 2.1 Core intent (tool + outcome)
- "product mockup generator"
- "ecommerce product mockups" / "shopify product mockups"
- "social media mockups" / "instagram ad mockups" / "facebook ad mockups"
- "saas product mockups" / "app mockups for ads"

**Intent:** People want visually strong, platform-ready mockups for ecommerce products, SaaS apps, or launches — often with ads or social posts in mind.

### 2.2 Supporting/long-tail
- "mockups for facebook ads" / "instagram post mockups"
- "amazon listing mockups" / "etsy product mockups"
- "product launch mockups" / "campaign mockups"

**Intent:** Align landing sections and examples with these use-cases and ensure internal links route them into relevant templates/campaign flows.

  - Short lead: This is the key funnel section.
  - **H3:** `Step 1 — Create product mockups`
  - **H3:** `Step 2 — Drop them into ad and social templates`
  - **H3:** `Step 3 — Schedule your campaign in planner`
  - Include small visual/diagram callout tying into planner "Campaign Mode" (from flow spec).
  - Primary CTA: `Start a campaign with product mockups` (deep-link into planner campaign mode where possible).

- **H2:** `Run campaigns in 100+ languages with one set of mockups`
  - **H3:** `Create once, localize everywhere`
  - **H3:** `Group multilingual variants in a single campaign view`
  - Link to:

    - `/instagram-post-templates/`
    - `/weekly-content-packs/` (if/when exists).

### Section 7 — FAQs & intent cleanup

    - "Can I use these mockups for Facebook/Instagram ads?"

    - "Do I have to schedule campaigns, or can I just download?"
    - "How do multilingual campaigns work?"

## 5. Internal Linking Plan

**Primary internal links from `/product-mockups/`:**
- To planner/scheduler:
  - `/social-media-planner/` (or equivalent) — from hero + flow section.
  - `/social-media-scheduler/` — where relevant.
- To template clusters:
  - `/social-media-templates/`
  - `/facebook-ad-templates/`
  - `/instagram-post-templates/`
- To suite flagship tools:
  - `/logo-maker/` (brand foundation)
  - `/meme-generator/` (top-of-funnel creative)
- To multilingual overview:
  - `/multi-language-social-media/` or central language feature page.

**Key rule:** any user who lands on `/product-mockups/` should see at least one clear path into:
1. **Starting a campaign with mockups** (deep link into planner campaign mode).
2. **Exploring campaign templates** (template cluster URLs).

---

## 6. Conversion & Funnel Notes

- Primary conversion: signup + first **mockup-to-campaign** flow (mockup created → ad set drafted → posts scheduled).
- Key events to track (aligned with Analytics v2):
  - `product_mockup_created`
  - `mockup_added_to_campaign_template`
  - `campaign_created_from_product_mockups`
  - `posts_scheduled_in_campaign_from_mockups`
- Add at least one **inline CTA** in each major section that routes to planner or campaign templates, not just to the mockup tool, to avoid the "download and leave" dead-end.

---

## 7. Next Steps

- Align this structure with the existing `/product-mockups/` implementation and update headings/meta.
- Confirm actual internal link targets (ensure destination URLs exist or are planned in the cluster map).
- Coordinate with @product-ux to align section 4 visuals with the 3-step mockup → ads → schedule wizard and planner Campaign Mode.
