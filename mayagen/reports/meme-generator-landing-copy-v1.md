# Meme Generator Landing Page — Copy & Structure v1

## Page Goal
Convert high-intent, meme-curious visitors into:
1. Signed-up Mayagen users
2. First meme created
3. First social post scheduled — showcasing the full "create → plan → schedule" flow in 100+ languages.

## Target User
- Social media managers, founders, and creators who want fast, on-brand memes.
- Often starting from search ("meme generator", "make memes for social media"), expecting a free, no-friction tool.

## Core Narrative
- Start with the meme (fun, low-friction entry).
- Reveal that the real power is turning memes into consistent, scheduled campaigns across channels and languages.
- Emphasize that Mayagen is not just a meme editor — it is a content suite.

## Proposed Structure

### 1. Hero: "Make memes that actually ship."

**Headline**  
Make memes that actually ship.

**Sub-headline**  
Create scroll-stopping memes, turn them into posts, and schedule campaigns in 100+ languages — all in one place.

**Primary CTA**  
- Button: **Start free with Meme Generator**  
  - Supporting text: "No credit card. Create your first meme in under 30 seconds."

**Secondary CTA**  
- Text link: "See how it works →" (scrolls to flow section showing create → plan → schedule)

**Hero support points (3 bullets)**
- AI-assisted captions tuned for each social channel.
- Brand-safe templates that match your logo, colors, and fonts.
- One-click "Use in social post" to move from meme to scheduled campaign.

Hero should show:
- The meme canvas on the left.
- On the right, a mini-view of the planner with a scheduled post using that meme.

### 2. Flow Strip: From meme idea → scheduled campaign

Short section immediately below hero to make the suite visible.

**Section title**  
From first meme to full campaign.

**Body copy**  
"Meme Generator is your starting point. Mayagen handles everything after: planning, translating, and scheduling your posts so they actually go live."

**Three-step visual flow**
1. **Create** — "Turn any idea into a meme with AI captions, brand fonts, and safe templates."
2. **Plan** — "Drop your meme into the content planner alongside posts, mockups, and logo-led assets."
3. **Schedule** — "Publish across channels in 100+ languages with localized captions, not copy-paste translations."

Add a secondary CTA here: **"Plan a meme campaign"** → opens planner pre-filled with the created meme.

### 3. Why teams start with memes (but stay for the suite)

**Section title**  
Start with memes. Stay for the system.

**Body copy**  
"Meme Generator is free and fast, but it is most powerful when it plugs into your full content workflow. Mayagen connects memes to brand kits, templates, and scheduled posts — so your best ideas don't die in the downloads folder."

**Three columns**
- **On-brand by default**  
  "Pull in your logo, colors, and fonts from Mayagen's brand kit so every meme feels like you."

- **Ready for every channel**  
  "Auto-resize and re-caption for Instagram, LinkedIn, X, and more — without starting over."

- **Built for 100+ languages**  
  "Translate the joke, not just the words. Mayagen suggests localized lines that land in each market."

### 4. Feature Deep Dive: Meme Generator inside the suite

  - Drag-and-drop layouts for classic meme formats.
  - Image upload, stock search, and template library.

### 5. Social proof & example campaigns

**Section title**  
See how teams use memes to power full campaigns.

**Body copy**  
"Mayagen customers start with a single meme and end up with full, scheduled campaigns — in every market they care about."

**Examples (cards)**

  "Yes. You can create and download memes for free. Planning and scheduling campaigns sit inside the Mayagen suite, available on paid plans."

### 7. Closing CTA: From meme to scheduled campaign

**Headline**  
Turn today’s meme into next week’s campaign.

**Body copy**

## Implementation Notes

- Ensure all key sections are crawlable and align with SEO v2 recommendations for `/meme-generator/` (H1, H2s, internal links to planner/scheduler pages, etc.).
- Add clear internal links from Meme Generator page to:
  - Planner overview
  - Scheduler overview
  - Brand kit / logo maker (for users who want to align memes with their brand).
- Track funnel steps: visit → meme created → "Use in social post" clicked → post scheduled → campaign completed.
