## 1. Primary Use Cases

### 1.1 Ecommerce product shots
- Clean, on-brand product-on-background images for:
  - Product detail pages (PDP hero + secondary images)
  - Social organic posts (Instagram, Facebook, Pinterest)
  - Paid ads (Meta, Google, TikTok)
- Typical intents:
  - "Make my Amazon-looking product photos feel like a real brand."
  - "Generate seasonal variants (Diwali, Black Friday, Christmas) fast."
  - "Create consistent ad creative for a small product catalog."

### 1.2 Ecommerce lifestyle & UGC-style mockups
- Contextual, lifestyle scenes that place the product in real-world settings.
- UGC-style frames tuned for Reels/TikTok + Stories.
- Typical intents:
  - "Turn my boring studio shots into lifestyle creatives."
  - "Create UGC-style mockups without hiring creators."

### 1.3 SaaS & digital product visuals
- App screens, dashboards, feature highlights rendered into clean layouts.
- Use in:
  - Landing page hero/feature sections
  - Social announcement posts
  - Retargeting ads showing product value
- Typical intents:
  - "I have raw screenshots; make them look like polished product visuals."
  - "Create multiple feature highlight images from one base dashboard."

### 1.4 Launch/offer-specific mockups
- Mockups tuned to a specific campaign: sale, launch, new feature, season.
- Often created in batches (5–20 assets) per campaign.
- Typical intents:
  - "Generate a launch creative set for my new product."
  - "Create multiple ad variants for A/B testing."

## 2. Ideal Flow: Mockup → Ad Template → Scheduled Campaign

We want Product Mockups to act as the **creative entry point** into a full campaign, not a dead-end download tool.

High-level funnel:

1. **User generates a mockup (or batch) in Product Mockups**
   - Input: product image(s), brand colors, short campaign goal (optional), target channels.
   - Output: 3–9 suggested mockups grouped as a "creative set".

2. **User selects 1–3 favorite mockups**
   - Primary CTA: **"Use in social ads"** (not just "Download").
   - Secondary CTAs: Download PNG/JPG, copy to Brand Kit, duplicate & edit.

3. **Mayagen opens an "Ad Template" composer with selected mockups pre-filled**
   - For each mockup, generate:
     - Suggested primary text + headline + description.
     - Channel-appropriate aspect ratios (square, vertical, landscape) where needed.
   - Present as a focused "Create ad set" view, not the full planner yet.

4. **User confirms/edit copy & channels → saves as a Campaign Draft**
   - Campaign object properties:
     - Name (auto from goal, editable)
     - Channels (IG, FB, LinkedIn, X, etc.)
     - Number of creatives
     - Date range (start/end)
   - Primary CTA: **"Schedule this campaign"**.

5. **Planner/Scheduler opens in "Campaign mode"**
   - Pre-populate calendar with:
     - Recommended posting times per channel
     - Each mockup+copy pair mapped to specific slots
   - Let the user:
     - Adjust days/times
     - Toggle channels per asset
     - Optionally add 1–2 extra posts for warm-up/retargeting.

6. **User confirms → campaign scheduled**
   - Confirmation screen summarizing:
     - Number of posts
     - Channels
     - Date range
   - Follow-up nudge: "Want a weekly content pack like this?" → route into Weekly Content Pack experiments later.

## 3. Landing Page & Internal Link Implications (v1 sketch)

This heartbeat focuses on clarifying use cases + high-level flow. Landing structure and precise internal links will be detailed next, but at a high level:

- Position Product Mockups as:
  - "Turn product photos into ready-to-run ad campaigns."
  - Not just a background remover or static mockup gallery.
- Key flows the page should highlight:
  1. **Ecommerce product shots → social ads → scheduled campaign.**
  2. **SaaS screens → feature highlight visuals → launch/retargeting posts.**
- Internal links:
  - Deep link into planner/scheduler in "campaign mode" where possible.
  - Cross-link from Product Mockups to Meme Generator and Logo Maker as complementary creative sources.

Next step (future heartbeat):
- Turn this into a concrete landing page outline (H1/H2s) and add an internal-link map consistent with SEO v2.
