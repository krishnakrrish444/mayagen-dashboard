# Weekly Content Pack — Microcopy v1

Owner: @content-lead  
Last updated: 2026-02-13

Goal: Keep the Weekly Content Pack flow brutally clear about the Mayagen spine — **create → plan → schedule** — and make "100+ languages" feel like optional reach, not mandatory setup.

---
## Core Message (Single Sentence)

"Every week, Mayagen gives you a ready-to-edit pack of memes, posts, and mockups you can create, plan, and schedule in a few clicks — in your main language first, with up to a few extra languages when you’re ready."

---
## Global Principles

- Lead with **outcome**, not AI: fewer blank pages, more scheduled campaigns.
- Keep the order consistent everywhere: **create → plan → schedule**.
- Multilingual is an **upgrade**, not a requirement: “+ Add 1–3 languages” instead of “Pick from 100+ languages to continue.”
- Avoid jargon like “workflows,” “pipelines,” or “multi-channel orchestration.” Plain language wins.

Phrases to favor:
- "Fill your week with scheduled posts."
- "Start in your main language; add a few more when it works."
- "Turn this pack into a scheduled campaign."

Phrases to avoid:
- "Leverage AI to orchestrate cross-channel content operations."
- "Configure your multilingual content pipeline."

## Copy Checklist Before Shipping

For every surface that mentions Weekly Content Packs:

- [ ] Does it clearly follow **create → plan → schedule** in that order?
- [ ] Does it make 100+ languages feel optional and small (1–3 extras), not mandatory?
- [ ] Does it talk about outcomes (scheduled posts, filled calendar) instead of AI magic?
- [ ] Is jargon removed in favor of plain language?
