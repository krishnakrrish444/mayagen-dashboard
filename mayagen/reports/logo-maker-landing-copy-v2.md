_Last updated: 2026-02-13_

This v2 draft sharpens suite messaging for Logo Designer: **create → plan → schedule** in **100+ languages**, with Logo Designer as the entry point to a living brand system and coordinated launch.

---

## 1. Above the Fold

**Page title (H1)**  
Logo Designer – Design your brand, then launch it everywhere.

**Sub-heading (hero)**  
Create a logo, turn it into a living brand kit, and roll out coordinated launch campaigns across channels and languages—without leaving Mayagen.

**Supporting line (microcopy)**  
Mayagen connects Logo Designer to your Brand Kit, templates, planner, and scheduler so you can go from "no logo" to a fully scheduled, multilingual launch in under 30 minutes.

**Primary CTA**  
`Design your logo & launch kit`

**Secondary CTA**  
`See logo-to-launch flow` (scrolls to the flow strip)

**Hero badges (examples)**
- "Includes planner & scheduler"
- "Multilingual-ready (100+ languages)"
- "Create → plan → schedule from one workspace"

## 2. Flow Strip – Create → Plan → Schedule in One Guided Flow

**Section heading (H2)**  
From first logo idea to scheduled launch, in one flow

**Intro copy**  
Most logo tools end at a file download. Logo Designer is wired into your planner and scheduler, so the journey looks like this:

> **Create** a logo → **Plan** your launch kit → **Schedule** posts in 100+ languages

**Step cards (H3 + body)**

1. **Create – Design your logo with AI-guided exploration**  
   Describe your name, industry, and style. Explore AI-powered logo directions with clear, guided feedback instead of random options.

2. **Create – Auto-build a brand kit from your chosen logo**  
   Turn your selected logo into a living Brand Kit—colors, fonts, spacing, and usage rules that apply everywhere in Mayagen: Meme Generator, Product Mockups, and social templates.

3. **Plan – Generate launch-ready assets from your brand kit**  
   Spin up profile photos, cover images, announcement graphics, and promo templates that inherit your brand automatically, ready to drop into campaigns.

4. **Plan – Map assets to campaigns in your content planner**  
   Add your launch assets into Mayagen's planner, organize by campaign, channel, and market, and see your launch week as one coherent story instead of disconnected posts.

5. **Schedule – Publish a multilingual launch in one calendar**  
   Use the scheduler to pick dates, times, and platforms for each market. Create language variants in one view, keep visuals synced, and ship your launch in 100+ languages from a single calendar.

Inline labels:
- Badge: "Brand Kit included"
- Badge: "Planner + scheduler built in"
- Badge: "Multilingual launch ready"

## 3. Value Section – Your Logo Becomes a System, Not a File

**Section heading (H2)**  
Your logo is the start of a system, not the end of a project

**Intro copy**  
A standalone logo file is hard to scale. In Mayagen, your logo becomes the source of truth for every meme, mockup, ad, and scheduled post.

**Three-column value blocks (H3 + bullets)**

### Explore & decide faster
- Capture your name, product, and values once; Logo Designer generates structured directions, not random styles.
- Preview concepts on real surfaces—social profiles, covers, posts, and product shots—before you commit.
- Compare variants (light/dark, stacked/horizontal, icon-only) side by side with clear guidance.

### Auto-brand everything
- Save your chosen logo as a Brand Kit with one click.
- Apply branding automatically across Meme Generator, Product Mockups, carousels, and campaign templates.
- Keep colors, typography, and logo usage consistent across every language and channel, without manual checking.

### Connect to real outcomes
- Turn each logo into a reusable launch kit: announcement, countdown, and "now live" posts.
- See where your brand shows up across campaigns and channels inside the planner.
- Reuse the same kit for promos, feature launches, and seasonal campaigns in a few clicks.

## 4. Multilingual Branding & Launch (100+ Languages)

**Section heading (H2)**  
Multilingual by design, from day one

**Intro copy**  
Nano Banana Pro powers names, taglines, and launch copy that feel native—not machine-translated—for every market you care about.

**Key bullets**
- Explore names, slogans, and taglines in multiple languages while keeping your visual system consistent.
- Generate logo lockups and tagline treatments per market (e.g., EN, ES, PT-BR, HI) from a single Brand Kit.
- Create localized launch sequences—captions + visuals—for each language and schedule them together on the same calendar.
- Review language variants side by side and adjust tone, formality, and idioms per market before publishing.

**Design suggestion**  
Tabs or a dropdown for languages (EN, ES, FR, HI, etc.) that updates:
- A logo + tagline preview
- Sample launch posts for each language
- How they appear on the shared calendar view

## 5. How Logo Designer Fits Into the Mayagen Suite

**Section heading (H2)**  
The starting point for your visual & social command center

**Short narrative**  
Logo Designer is where your brand enters Mayagen. From there, every tool understands your identity and campaign plan.

**Simple flow narrative**
1. **Create** – Start in Logo Designer to define your visual identity.
2. **Create/Plan** – Mayagen turns it into a Brand Kit that powers Meme Generator, Product Mockups, and social templates.
3. **Plan** – Use the planner to organize launches, promos, and recurring content around your new brand.
4. **Schedule** – Use the scheduler to publish, in 100+ languages, across platforms with time zones and pacing handled for you.

**Bulleted highlights**
- One Brand Kit that powers every creative tool in Mayagen.
- Templates for memes, promos, and product shots that stay on-brand by default.
- A shared calendar where every post, in every language, pulls from the same brand system.
- Clear, repeatable flows: meme → campaign, mockup → launch, logo → brand rollout.

Suggested visual: a simple diagram `Logo Designer` → `Brand Kit` → `Templates & assets` → `Planner` → `Scheduler`.

## 6. Story & Social Proof – Time to Launch

**Section heading (H2)**  
From "no logo" to launch week in under 30 minutes

**Narrative block**  
Show the before/after:
- Before: scattered work across logo tools, design files, and separate social schedulers.
- After: one flow inside Mayagen that handles creation, planning, and scheduling in multiple languages.

**Placeholder testimonial**  
> "We went from no logo to a brand kit and a full week of launch posts—in English, Spanish, and Portuguese—in a single afternoon. I didn't touch a design file or spreadsheet."  
> — Early-stage founder (to be replaced with a real quote)

**Metric-oriented microcopy**
- Teams typically ship their first week of launch posts in under 30 minutes after choosing a logo.
- Multilingual launches reuse the same visuals; only copy and scheduling adapt per language.

## 8. Notes for Product, Design & Implementation

- Reuse layout patterns from other flagship tools so Meme Generator, Logo Designer, and Product Mockups clearly feel like parts of one suite.
- Make the **create → plan → schedule** language explicit in at least one hero element and one "how it fits into the suite" section.
- Ensure CTAs like "Design your logo & launch kit" and "Open in Planner" map to real in-product routes: Brand Kit setup, campaign planner, and scheduler views.
- Tie language controls to shared suite-wide language settings so Logo Designer, templates, and scheduler stay in sync for 100+ languages.
- Consider a "Logo-to-launch" guided mode that pre-configures the first calendar entries once a logo is approved, so users experience the full flow on day one.
