# Product Mockups → Campaign Archetypes & Planner Templates (v1)

Owner: @seo-growth  
Date: 2026-02-13

This doc turns the Product Mockups "mockup → ads → Campaign Mode" funnel into a small set of concrete campaign archetypes and planner templates. The goal is to: (a) make it obvious what to do **after** creating mockups, and (b) push users toward a **scheduled campaign** and **weekly habit**, not one-off posts.

## 1. Core Principles

1. **Campaign-first, not asset-first**  
   Every surface after a successful mockup should answer: *"What campaign do you want to run with this?"* rather than *"Where should we download this?"*

2. **Small, time-bounded plans**  
   Planner templates should be 7–14 day plans with 3–8 posts, not full content calendars.

3. **One main job per archetype**  
   Each archetype has a single success metric (e.g., first orders, trials, or demo requests) and a simple narrative arc.

4. **Multilingual as a reach boost**  
   Multilingual variants are an **optional upgrade**: 1–3 extra languages per campaign, grouped per base post, not an explosion of separate posts.

## 2. Archetype A — Product Launch Week (Ecommerce)

**Who:** DTC / ecommerce brand launching a new product or collection.  
**Source:** Product Mockups → `Use in ads & campaign` → Launch Week template.

### Template structure (7 days)

- **Day 1 — Launch Hero**  
  - 1 post: "New drop" or hero announcement using the strongest mockup.
  - Channels: IG feed, FB page (optionally X / LinkedIn depending on category).

- **Day 2 — Social Proof Teaser**  
  - 1 post: early reviews, founder quote, or "why we made this" with a lifestyle mockup.

- **Day 3 — Feature Carousel**  
  - 1–2 posts: carousel or thread highlighting 3 key features / benefits.

- **Day 4 — Behind the Scenes / Making Of**  
  - 1 post: process, materials, or team story with more candid mockups.

- **Day 5 — Offer / Bundle**  
  - 1 post: launch offer, bundle, or value stack using a price-focused mockup.

- **Day 6 — UGC / Community**  
  - 1 post: invite to share photos, or repurpose real customer shots once available.

- **Day 7 — Recap + Last Chance**  
  - 1 post: recap of week + a clear CTA to purchase.

### Planner template behavior

- Pre-fill a **7-day campaign** labeled `New product launch` with the above posts as editable drafts.
- Allow the user to **swap mockups** per post directly from the assets created in this session.
- Single CTA in Campaign Mode: **Schedule this campaign** (schedules all 7 posts).

### Key metrics

- Time from `mockup_created` → `campaign_scheduled_from_mockups` (launch campaign).  
- % of users who start Launch Week template and schedule at least 1 post.  
- % of Launch Week campaigns with ≥ 1 extra language (multilingual reach boost).

## 3. Archetype B — Always-On Offer / Evergreen Campaign (Ecommerce)

**Who:** Stores with stable offers (free shipping, bundles, subscriptions).  
**Source:** Product Mockups → `Use in evergreen campaign`.

### Template structure (14 days)

- 5–6 posts rotated over 14 days:
  - Core value prop (hero mockup)
  - Best-sellers or bundle highlight
  - Social proof / testimonials
  - FAQ / objection handling
  - Reminder / urgency post

Planner treats this as an **evergreen loop**: once scheduled, user can duplicate this 14‑day block forward.

### Planner template behavior

- Pre-fill a 14‑day range with 5–6 posts and recommend 2–3 channels.
- Surface a **"Repeat this campaign"** CTA after completion to encourage ongoing habit.

### Key metrics

- % of users who duplicate the 14‑day template (habit signal).  
- Weekly active planner users with `source = "product_mockups"`.

---
## 4. Archetype C — SaaS Feature Launch / Release Campaign

**Who:** SaaS / software products announcing a new feature or major release.  
**Source:** Product Mockups → `Use in feature launch`.

### Template structure (7–10 days)

- **Announcement** — feature hero visual and core benefit.  
- **Deep dive** — mockups of UI with 2–3 concrete use cases.  
- **Customer story** — narrative with quote + product visuals.  
- **How-to** — short tutorial clips or carousels using mockups.  
- **Reminder / recap** — why it matters + CTA to try the feature.

### Planner template behavior

- Emphasize **LinkedIn + X** as defaults, with optional IG/FB depending on visuals.
- One-click **"Turn this into a product update series"** to duplicate posts over the next month.

### Key metrics

- % of feature launch campaigns that schedule ≥ 3 posts.  
- Time to first scheduled feature-launch post from `mockup_created`.

## 5. Archetype D — Seasonal / Sale Campaign

**Who:** Brands running seasonal events (Black Friday, Diwali, summer sale, etc.).  
**Source:** Product Mockups → `Use in seasonal sale`.

### Template structure (variable, 7–14 days)

- Pre-built templates for major seasons with:
  - Save‑the‑date / early tease
  - Offer reveal
  - Social proof / "what to buy" guides
  - Mid‑sale reminder
  - Last‑chance posts

### Planner template behavior

- Attach a **date range** to the campaign and auto-suggest slots (e.g., 2–3 posts per week leading into the event, then daily during sale).
- Suggest a **post-schedule recap** post once the campaign ends to drive habit and reuse of the planner.

### Key metrics

- Adoption of seasonal templates vs ad‑hoc scheduling.  
- % of seasonal campaigns that use grouped language variants.

---
## 6. Multilingual as an Optional Upgrade

For all archetypes:

- Default: single language based on workspace or browser locale.
- Optional: `+ Add language` control in Campaign Mode with a **soft cap of 3 languages** total.
- Group posts by base message; show language badges on each tile.
- Offer a single **"Translate this campaign"** CTA that:
  - Clones base posts into selected languages using Mayagen's language model.
  - Keeps scheduling aligned (same dates/times unless user edits).

Metrics:

- % of campaigns with ≥ 2 languages.  
- Time added by enabling multilingual vs base campaign only.  
- Retention: weekly active planner users who first activated via Product Mockups **and** ran a multilingual campaign.

## 7. How This Connects to Weekly Habit

- Product Mockups → archetype selection → **campaign template in planner** → one-click **Schedule this campaign**.  
- After the campaign completes, planner surfaces:
  - A **"Plan your next 2 weeks"** CTA reusing the best-performing posts/mockups.  
  - A gentle nudge to try a different archetype (e.g., from Launch Week → Evergreen).

This keeps the story consistent with Mayagen's core spine: users start with assets, but the real win is getting them to **create → plan → schedule** campaigns that repeat, not just download pretty images.
