# Mayagen Product Strategy v2

_Last updated: 2026-02-12_

## 1. Core Positioning, Personas & Journeys

### 1.1. Core Product Positioning

**Current reality:**
- 45+ graphics tools (memes, logos, flyers, ads, infographics, event graphics, mockups, etc.)
- Social content planner
- Social post scheduler
- Nano Banana Pro under the hood for multilingual creativity (100+ languages)

**New north star positioning:**

> **Mayagen is the AI visual & social command center for creators and small businesses.**
> One place to turn ideas into multilingual visuals, plan content, and auto‑publish everywhere.

Key ideas:
- **Command center, not toolbox** – shift from “lots of tools” to “one workflow.”
- **End-to-end:** idea → content → visual → caption → approval → schedule → analytics.
- **Multilingual by default:** every step (ideation, copy, visuals, scheduling) works across 100+ languages.
- **Social-first graphics:** tailored for feeds, stories, ads and promos, not generic design.

Positioning pillars:
1. **Unified workflow** – graphics, copy, planner and scheduler live together.
2. **Context-aware AI** – reuses brand, past posts, and goals across tools.
3. **Multilingual growth** – reach new regions and niches without translation overhead.
4. **Speed to publish** – focus on how fast users get a quality post into the queue.

Tagline directions:
- “From idea to scheduled post in minutes.”
- “Your visual & social workflow, in one AI-powered workspace.”
- “Design, plan, and schedule multilingual content — in one place.”

### 1.2. Personas

#### Persona A – Solo Creator / Influencer

- **Who:** YouTuber, TikTok/IG creator, podcaster, newsletter writer.
- **Goals:** Grow audience, keep consistent posting cadence, maintain visual identity without a designer.
- **Behaviors:**
  - Posts 3–20 times/week across 2–4 channels.
  - Juggles Canva/Figma, Notion, and platform-native schedulers.
  - Often works from a backlog of ideas or content calendar docs.
- **Pain points:**
  - Context switching across tools.
  - Repeating similar designs manually (thumbnails, episode covers, carousels).
  - Last-minute posts, irregular cadence.
  - Difficult to test multiple languages.
- **Success metric:** Faster, more consistent posting with higher engagement.

#### Persona B – Small Business Owner / Local Brand

- **Who:** Café owner, beauty salon, gym, real estate agent, ecommerce shop with 1–20 employees.
- **Goals:** Drive foot traffic or sales, run promos, look professional on social without hiring an agency.
- **Behaviors:**
  - Posts 2–10 times/week, mostly to Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp Business, maybe TikTok.
  - Often a single owner or assistant handles marketing.
  - Occasional ad campaigns; seasonal promos.
- **Pain points:**
  - No time/skill to design from scratch.
  - Needs posts in multiple languages for local communities (e.g., English + Spanish).
  - Confused by too many tools; needs presets.
- **Success metric:** Simple, repeatable promo workflows that “just work” each week.

#### Persona C – Micro Marketing Team / Agency Pod

- **Who:** 2–10 person marketing teams, boutique agencies managing 3–20 brands.
- **Goals:** Scale content production, standardize templates, collaborate, hit client calendars.
- **Behaviors:**
  - Uses Trello/Asana + Google Drive + design tools + Buffer/Later/etc.
  - Needs approvals and version history.
- **Pain points:**
  - Fragmented stack, hard to keep brand consistency.
  - Manual localization for multiple markets.
  - Bottlenecks around designers.
- **Success metric:** Fewer tools, more throughput per marketer, easier approvals.

These three personas anchor decisions around flows, packaging, and roadmap.

### 1.3. Core User Journeys

At the highest level, all personas perform variations of these journeys:

1. **Idea → Multilingual post → Schedule** (core growth engine)
2. **Campaign → Asset set (graphics + captions) → Calendar rollout**
3. **Brand onboarding → Reusable templates → Ongoing content**
4. **Existing asset → Variations (formats / languages / platforms)**
5. **Analytics signal → Adjust strategy → New content plan**

#### Journey 1 – Idea → Multilingual post → Schedule

**Narrative:**
“I have an idea (or prompt) and want a post ready for tomorrow for IG + TikTok, in English and Spanish, with on-brand visuals and captions.”

Steps:
1. Enter idea into a unified **Content Composer** (text area or guided prompts).
2. AI suggests: post concepts, visual styles, captions, hashtags, and posting times.
3. User picks a concept; Mayagen:
   - Generates a visual using the most suitable graphics tool.
   - Auto-adapts visual to multiple sizes (IG feed, story, TikTok cover).
   - Generates multilingual captions.
4. User tweaks design or copy inline.
5. One-click **“Schedule to all”** with platform/time recommendations.

Success criteria:
- Time-to-scheduled-post < 5 minutes for a simple single-post use case.
- Zero need to manually jump between tools.

#### Journey 2 – Campaign → Asset set → Calendar rollout

**Narrative:**
“I’m running a Valentine’s Day sale and need a week-long campaign across channels.”

Steps:
1. Select **Campaign Wizard** (goal: promo, launch, event, etc.).
2. Define goal, date range, target platforms, and languages.
3. AI proposes a mini content plan: key messages, number and type of posts.
4. For each suggested post, AI:
   - Generates base graphic (flyer/ad/post) + variants per platform.
   - Drafts captions and call-to-actions.
   - Suggests posting schedule across the date range.
5. User edits at batch or per-post level, then confirms.
6. All assets and posts appear in the **Calendar View** as a cohesive campaign.

Success criteria:
- “Campaign from scratch” in ≤ 30 minutes.
- Most users reuse campaign templates across seasons.

#### Journey 3 – Brand onboarding → Reusable templates → Ongoing content

**Narrative:**
“I want all my posts to look like my brand, even if AI is making them.”

Steps:
1. Brand onboarding: upload logo, pick colors & fonts, provide brand statement and tone.
2. Mayagen builds a **Brand Kit** and suggests initial template sets (e.g., promotions, announcements, testimonials, quotes, carousels, memes-with-branding).
3. Templates become the default starting point in all graphics tools and campaign flows.
4. Over time, AI learns preferred layouts and suggests “Your style” first.

Success criteria:
- >70% of posts over time leverage on-brand templates.
- Switching accounts/brands in Teams reflows everything to that brand kit.

#### Journey 4 – Existing asset → Variations

**Narrative:**
“I have a design or a post that worked. I want 10 variations for different platforms/languages.”

Steps:
1. Import existing asset (image, URL, or choose from library).
2. Choose **“Repurpose & Scale”**.
3. AI:
   - Detects layout and brand.
   - Generates variants optimized for each platform and format.
   - Creates translations/localized copy for selected languages.
4. User approves and schedules variants in bulk.

Success criteria:
- Repurposing any single asset into a 5–10 post set in < 10 minutes.

#### Journey 5 – Analytics signal → Adjust strategy → New content plan

(This is more mid/late roadmap.)

Steps:
1. View simple analytics per platform/post type.
2. AI highlights what’s working and underperforming.
3. “Generate next week’s plan based on what performed best.”
4. User confirms or tweaks, then assets are generated and scheduled.

Success criteria:
- Analytics are actionable, not just charts.

## 2. 12-Month Product Roadmap (3 Phases)

Roadmap principles:
- Prioritize **suite cohesion** over adding new isolated tools.
- Build **cross-tool workflows** (idea → visual → schedule → analyze).
- Invest in **depth**: brand, templates, localization, scheduling reliability.

### Phase 1 (Months 0–4): Unify & Streamline

**Theme:** From toolbox to workflow.

Objectives:
- Create a single, guided way to go from idea to scheduled post.
- Reduce fragmentation between graphics tools and planner/scheduler.
- Start enforcing brand consistency.

Key initiatives:

1. **Unified Content Composer (MVP)**
   - One entry point for: quick posts, carousels, simple campaigns.
   - Takes in: topic/idea, goal (engagement/sale/announcement), platforms, languages.
   - Integrates with Nano Banana Pro for:
     - Idea expansion
     - Caption generation (multilingual)
     - Graphics prompt generation routed to the right visual tool.

2. **Cross-Tool Asset Pipeline**
   - Standardize an internal “Post” object linking:
     - Visual(s) (images, videos later)
     - Caption(s) per platform & language
     - Hashtags, CTAs, links
     - Schedule metadata
   - Ensure every graphics tool can either:
     - Start from a Post object, or
     - Create/update one on save.

3. **Basic Brand Kit & Defaults**
   - Brand Kit v1: logo upload, color palette, font presets.
   - All graphics tools read from Brand Kit by default.
   - Simple “Apply brand” toggle on any design.

4. **Scheduler–Graphics Integration**
   - From graphics editor: **“Use in a post”** → opens Composer with the visual preloaded, auto-generates captions.
   - From Calendar: clicking a slot “Create post” opens Composer, not a random tool picker.

5. **Language-Aware Workflows (MVP)**
   - Default language detection based on workspace settings, with option to “Add languages.”
   - For each additional language:
     - Auto-translate captions.
     - Option: duplicate visual with localized text overlays (for text-heavy designs).

Outcomes by end of Phase 1:
- Most new users start with Composer, not a specific graphics tool.
- You can go idea → post → schedule from a single surface.
- Brand feel is more consistent.

### Phase 2 (Months 4–8): Deepen Workflows & Collaboration

**Theme:** Campaigns, collaboration, and localization depth.

Objectives:
- Make Mayagen the easiest way to run repeatable campaigns.
- Support basic team workflows.
- Make multilingual a first-class differentiator.

Key initiatives:

1. **Campaign Wizard v1**
   - Prebuilt campaign types: Launch, Promo/Sale, Event, Always-on content (quotes/testimonials), etc.
   - Generates:
     - Campaign brief summary
     - Suggested number of posts, post types, and timing
     - Draft assets list (graphics+captions)
   - Campaign view in calendar (grouped, color-coded).

2. **Multilingual Packs & Localization Controls**
   - Language packs: select languages once per project/brand.
   - Control levels per language:
     - Direct translation
     - Cultural adaptation (e.g., local idioms, call-to-action tweaks)
   - Show per-language previews in one unified view.

3. **Brand Kit v2 & Template System**
   - More advanced brand attributes: voice presets, “Do’s and Don’ts” for copy.
   - Save any design as a **Template**, tag it by use case (promo, quote, testimonial, etc.).
   - AI-suggested templates from your historical best-performing posts.

4. **Collaboration & Approvals (Teams Foundations)**
   - Roles: Owner, Editor, Viewer.
   - Basic approvals: assign a post to someone, mark “Needs review,” and approve.
   - Commenting on posts/campaigns and designs.

5. **Improved Calendar UX**
   - Drag-and-drop posts between days and times.
   - Filter by platform, campaign, status (draft, scheduled, published).
   - Inline edit captions and times from the calendar.

Outcomes by end of Phase 2:
- Clear value for small teams and agencies.
- Campaigns and localization are strong differentiators.
- Template reuse and brand consistency become visible strengths.

### Phase 3 (Months 8–12): Intelligence & Feedback Loops

**Theme:** Learn from performance and close the loop.

Objectives:
- Make Mayagen an adaptive system that suggests what to create next.
- Use analytics to refine content strategy and creative.

Key initiatives:

1. **Performance Insights v1**
   - Pull basic stats from connected platforms (impressions, engagement, clicks).
   - Attribute performance to:
     - Visual type (photo vs illustration vs meme).
     - Post type (promo vs educational vs announcement).
     - Format and time.
   - Simple Insights view: “These post types perform better,” “Best times per platform,” etc.

2. **Strategy Assistant**
   - “Generate next week’s content plan from my best-performing posts.”
   - “Create a variant of this post optimized for engagement/conversions.”
   - Recommend experiments: A/B image or caption variations.

3. **Smart Automation & Routines**
   - Saved flows: e.g., “Every Monday, generate 3 quote posts and schedule them between 6–9pm.”
   - Auto-fill calendar gaps with AI-suggested posts.

4. **Deeper Integrations & Extensibility**
   - Better social platform coverage and reliability.
   - Zapier/Make/Native APIs for agencies and advanced users.

Outcomes by end of Phase 3:
- Mayagen becomes not just a production tool, but a co-pilot for ongoing content strategy.
- Clear story: “The more you use it, the smarter it gets.”

## 4. Top 5 Critical Flows & UX Changes

These flows must feel **frictionless, obvious, and fast**. Everything else is secondary.

### Flow 1: Idea → Graphic → Scheduled Post in 5 Minutes

**Who:** All personas; especially Creators.

**Today’s likely pain:**
- Start in a graphics tool, then manually hop to scheduler.
- No single screen that holistically handles idea → design → caption → schedule.

**Future UX:**
1. Global **“New Post”** button from anywhere.
2. Opens **Unified Composer**:
   - “What’s your idea?” prompt.
   - Choose platforms and languages.
3. AI proposes:
   - Post concepts with auto-generated graphic thumbnails.
   - Captions per platform & language.
4. User selects a concept → inline graphics editor for quick tweaks.
5. Inline schedule widget (time, date suggestions) without leaving the page.
6. Press **“Schedule”** → single confirmation modal → done.

**Key UX changes required:**
- Introduce and prioritize Unified Composer as first entry point.
- Integrated mini graphics editor inside Composer (not full context switch).
- One combined summary panel: preview for each platform & language before scheduling.

---

### Flow 2: Promo/Campaign → Multi-Post Rollout

**Who:** Small businesses, Pro users, Teams.

**Future UX:**
1. From dashboard, **“New Campaign”** CTA.
2. Campaign Wizard collects:
   - Goal (e.g., 20% off weekend sale).
   - Date range.
   - Platforms & languages.
3. AI outputs:
   - Proposed schedule (e.g., teaser, announcement, reminders, last-chance).
   - For each slot: a suggested visual + caption.
4. User can:
   - Accept all with one click (“Create campaign”) or
   - Edit individual posts.
5. Campaign shows as a group in Calendar with a clear label.

**Key UX changes required:**
- Dedicated Campaign view in calendar.
- Group editing: edit call-to-action across all campaign posts.
- Campaign summary page for quick adjustments.

---

### Flow 3: Brand Onboarding → Branded Templates in Every Tool

**Who:** All paying tiers.

**Future UX:**
1. At first login or when creating a new brand:
   - Simple, friendly wizard: upload logo, choose colors, pick fonts, describe tone.
2. Mayagen shows **preview posts** using the brand kit.
3. User can click “Save as default look.”
4. Thereafter, every graphics tool and Composer:
   - Starts with brand styling applied.
   - Highlights “Brand Templates” first.

**Key UX changes required:**
- Consistent Brand Kit management area accessible from navigation.
- Brand variants (e.g., for different sub-brands) in a simple switcher.
- Visual cues when brand styling is active or overridden.

---

### Flow 4: Repurpose a High-Performing Post Across Platforms & Languages

**Who:** Creator, Pro, Teams.

**Future UX:**
1. From Analytics or Content Library, click a high-performing post → **“Repurpose”** button.
2. Choose target platforms and languages.
3. AI suggests:
   - Visual crops and variations.
   - Caption rewrites optimized per platform.
   - Localized text on the graphic if relevant.
4. Preview all variants in a grid.
5. One-click “Schedule variants” to auto-fill calendar slots.

**Key UX changes required:**
- Unified Content Library with filters by performance and type.
- Bulk scheduling UI that still feels clear and safe.
- Strong visual guidance when content differs by language/platform.

---

### Flow 5: Weekly Planning Session → Calendar Filled in 30 Minutes

**Who:** All personas; especially small businesses and Teams.

**Future UX:**
1. Weekly prompt/nudge: “Plan your content for next week in 20 minutes?”
2. From calendar, click **“Auto-plan week”**.
3. AI uses:
   - Past performance (when available), recurring patterns.
   - User’s indicated goals (growth, sales, engagement).
4. Generates a draft calendar:
   - Mix of content types (promo, educational, community, etc.).
   - Platform-specific suggestions.
5. User reviews in a compact view:
   - Accept, adjust, or delete slots.
   - Edit posts inline.
6. Confirm to schedule all.

**Key UX changes required:**
- Dedicated “Plan Week” meta-flow on top of calendar.
- Compact review mode (card-based or timeline) optimized for bulk confirmation.
- Ability to lock certain slots (e.g., “Don’t override my manual posts”).

- Invest early in a robust scheduling backend (retries, status tracking, error surfacing).

### 5.2. Success Metrics

Adoption & Engagement:
- % of users who start with **Unified Composer** vs. individual tools.
- Time from idea → scheduled post (measured via major flow instrumentation).
- Average scheduled posts per active user per month.

Revenue & Packaging:
- Conversion rate Free → Creator and Creator → Pro.
- Number of active brands per Teams account.

Differentiators:
- % of posts created with **>1 language**.
- % of scheduled posts that use **Brand Kit** templates.

Retention:
- 3- and 6‑month logo retention, especially for Creator and Pro.
- For Teams: number of active collaborators per workspace.
