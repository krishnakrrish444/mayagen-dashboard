# Product Mockups → Ad Templates → Scheduled Campaign Flow (v1)

Owner: @product-ux  
Date: 2026-02-13

Goal: Turn Product Mockups from a download-only tool into a fast path for **"idea → mockup → scheduled campaign" in ≈5–10 minutes**, with clear hooks into planner, scheduler, and multilingual controls.

---

## 1. Target User Stories

1. **Solo ecommerce founder**
   - "I have 3 product photos and a weekend sale. I want a small set of ad creatives and have them scheduled everywhere before lunch."
2. **SaaS marketer**
   - "I have a new feature. I want polished product visuals and coordinated announcement posts across LinkedIn, X, and email."
3. **Agency / freelancer**
   - "I need a mockup-based ad set for a client, plus a campaign calendar to get approval."

The flow must feel like a guided wizard that minimizes decisions while keeping power-user escape hatches.

---

## 2. Proposed End-to-End Flow (Happy Path)

### Step 0 – Entry & Intent

**Entry points:**
- `/product-mockups/` landing page primary CTA: **"Create product mockups"**.
- In-app navigation: Product Mockups tool card with microcopy: _"Turn product shots into ready-to-run ad campaigns"_.

On tool open, show a lightweight **"What are you creating?"** panel:
- Product type: dropdown (Apparel, Packaging, Device, SaaS UI, Other)
- Campaign goal (chips): Awareness, Launch, Promo/Sale, Always-on
- Channels (multi-select, defaults from most common): Instagram, Facebook, TikTok, Pinterest, LinkedIn
- Language: default from browser/locale with `+ Add language` (see §4)

Primary CTA: **"Start with these settings"** → goes to mockup generation.

---

### Step 1 – Generate Mockups (3–9 variants)

Screen: **"Generate your mockups"**

Inputs:
- Upload 1–3 base product images (drag-and-drop area).
- Optional short prompt: _"Describe your product or campaign"_ (e.g., "Summer sale: 30% off all skincare".).

On submit:
- Show progress with time expectation: _"Generating 6 mockups (≈10–20 seconds)…"_
- Output grid: 6 mockups grouped as a **"Creative set"**.

For each mockup tile:
- Thumbnail + tag chips (Lifestyle, Studio, UGC-style, Seasonal).
- Hover actions:
  - Checkbox **"Select for campaign"**
  - Quick zoom
  - "Edit layout" (opens advanced editor in side panel; optional)

Primary CTAs at bottom:
- **Primary:** `Use selected in ads` (disabled until ≥1 selected)
- **Secondary:** `Download selected (with watermark)`
- Tertiary text link: `Start over` (rarely used)

> UX note: The main friction to avoid is users defaulting to "Download" and leaving. Make **"Use selected in ads"** visually dominant and contextual: tooltip "Next: write ad copy & schedule posts".

---

### Step 2 – Ad Template Composer (Set up ad set)

When user clicks **"Use selected in ads"**:

Open an **Ad Set Composer** overlay (drawer or full-screen) instead of dropping them straight into the full planner.

Layout:
- Left: vertical list of selected mockups as slides.
- Center: preview of selected creative.
- Right: fields per channel:
  - Primary text
  - Headline
  - Description (if applicable)
  - CTA dropdown (Shop now, Learn more, Sign up, etc.)

Defaults:
- Pre-fill copy from Growth v2 patterns using:
  - Product description
  - Campaign goal
  - Selected channels & language(s)
- Show a **"Tone"** selector (Default, Playful, Professional, Bold).

Key UX elements:
- Badge at top: **"Step 2 of 3 – Write your ads"** (we foreshadow scheduling next).
- Persist a small banner: _"Next: Schedule this as a campaign in your calendar"_.

Primary CTAs:
- **Primary:** `Save as campaign draft`
- **Secondary:** `Back to mockups`

Behavior:
- `Save as campaign draft` creates a **Campaign object** with:
  - Name: autogenerated from goal (e.g., "Summer Skincare Launch") – editable.
  - Channels selected.
  - Number of creatives (count of selected mockups).
  - Default date range: next 7–14 days depending on goal.

Immediately after saving, show inline success state: _"Campaign draft saved – next: schedule it"_ with a single CTA: **"Open in calendar"**.

---

### Step 3 – Planner in "Campaign Mode"

On **"Open in calendar"**, transition to the planner with a dedicated **Campaign Mode** skin.

Key characteristics:

1. **Scoped view:**
   - Top pill: `Campaign: Summer Skincare Launch` with color.
   - Calendar auto-zooms to the campaign date range (e.g., next 10 days).
   - Filter is locked to show only posts for this campaign by default, with a clear `Show all content` toggle.

2. **Pre-populated slots:**
   - For each creative x channel combo, auto-suggest slots:
     - Use default posting windows (e.g., 10am/7pm local) from Growth v2.
   - Render them as **ghost cards** until confirmed:
     - Light outline, label: `Suggested – click to confirm`.

3. **Minimal required actions:**
   - User can:
     - Click each suggested slot to Confirm, Edit time, or Remove.
     - Bulk confirm with `Confirm all X posts` at top.
   - All advanced features (queues, labels) hidden behind `Advanced options` to keep this lightweight.

4. **Copy & mockup visibility:**
   - Hover over a slot to see mini-preview of the mockup + text.
   - Click opens a side panel with full creative details and per-language variants.

Primary CTA bar (sticky at bottom/right):
- `Confirm all posts (X)` – green, primary.
- `Cancel campaign` – secondary link.

On `Confirm all posts`:
- If user is not signed in or hasn’t connected accounts, trigger the **signup / connect account gate** (see §5).

---

### Step 4 – Confirmation & Next Steps

After posts are scheduled:
- Show a focused confirmation page/modal:
  - "You're set!" summary: X posts, Y channels, date range.
  - Visual: small calendar strip with colored dots on scheduled days.
- Offer 2 next steps:
  1. **"Add one more post for this campaign"** – quick path to duplicate/edit an existing creative.
  2. **"Turn this into a template"** – save as a reusable campaign blueprint for future launches.

Subtle prompt about multilingual (if only 1 language was used): _"Reach more customers: add a language and we'll auto-create localized variants."_ → deep link into language controls.

## 3. Friction Points & Concrete UX Changes

### 3.1 Current / Likely Frictions

1. **Download dead-end** – users default to "Download" and never see planner.
2. **Context switch overload** – jumping directly from creative tool to full calendar feels heavy and confusing.
3. **Too many decisions for first-time users** – channels, times, campaign naming, and language all at once.
4. **Multilingual complexity** – managing multiple languages in a flat calendar quickly becomes messy.

### 3.2 Changes to Reduce Friction

1. **Make campaign-first path dominant**
   - Primary CTA is always **"Use selected in ads"**.
   - Download is allowed but secondary and watermarked for free users.
   - Microcopy under primary CTA: _"Next: write your ads and schedule them in your calendar"_.

2. **Introduce a 3-step guided wizard**
   - Stepper across the top: `1. Mockups → 2. Ads → 3. Schedule`.
   - Each screen scoped to 1 decision type.
   - Clear time promise: _"Finish in under 10 minutes"_ shown on Step 1.

3. **Lightweight Campaign Mode in planner**
   - Hide unrelated posts by default; no cross-campaign clutter.
   - Ghost placeholders + `Confirm all` to minimize clicks.
   - Use short status copy like "Needs confirmation" vs generic labels.

4. **Urge but don’t force expansion**
   - Only require a minimum set of slots (e.g., at least 3 posts).
   - Offer an optional `+ Add warm-up post` suggestion once the base campaign is confirmed.

5. **Progressive disclosure of advanced scheduler features**
   - Keep queueing, categories, UTM parameters, etc. behind `Advanced` for this flow.
   - After a user completes 2+ campaigns, show a tip card about more powerful planner modes.

## 4. Multilingual UX for Mockup Campaigns

### 4.1 Language Selection

Upfront (Step 0):
- Default language from locale.
- `+ Add language` button opens a compact modal:
  - Recommended languages based on region (e.g., English + Arabic in MENA).
  - Explicit note: _"We'll keep all language versions grouped per post in your calendar."_

### 4.2 Variant Management in Ad Composer

In Step 2 (Ad Set Composer):
- Per-creative, show tabs or a dropdown for languages:
  - `EN`, `AR`, `ES`, etc.
- Copy fields per language are auto-translated/localized via Nano Banana Pro with tone preserved.
- "Lock" controls:
  - Checkbox: _"Keep layout & imagery identical across languages"_.
  - If unchecked, allow per-language tweaks to visuals.

### 4.3 Grouped Posts in Campaign Mode

In planner (Step 3):
- Each creative corresponds to a **post group**:
  - Visual primary tile shows base-language creative.
  - Small language pills below (e.g., `EN`, `AR`).
- The group occupies a **single time slot** per channel; publishing system sends all language variants at that time.

User options on a post group:
- `Edit languages` – open side panel to tweak text per language.
- `Hide language L for this channel` – if not relevant.

Calendar view tooltip:
- On hover: "This slot contains 1 image with 3 language variants (EN, AR, FR)."

This grouping prevents the calendar from becoming visually noisy while still making multilingual feel powerful and manageable.

## 5. Signup & Account Connection Gates

Where to gate:
1. **Before final scheduling**
   - If user is not logged in when clicking `Confirm all posts`, show modal:
     - Title: **"Save and auto-publish this campaign"**
     - Bullets: schedule across channels, remember your brand, support for 100+ languages.
   - After signup, return to the same Campaign Mode view with ghost posts still present.

2. **Before connecting social accounts**
   - After signup, if no channels are connected, show a simple 2-column dialog:
     - Left: progress (campaign ready, needs a channel).  
     - Right: buttons for each network.

3. **Non-blocking preview**
   - Allow user to see how the calendar would look even before connecting; we only block actual auto-posting.

---

## 6. Analytics & Success Metrics

Instrument events (aligned with Growth v2):

- `mockup_generated` (with attributes: product_type, goal, channels_count)
- `mockup_selected_for_campaign` (count per session)
- `ad_campaign_draft_created_from_mockups` (campaign_id)
- `campaign_opened_in_planner_from_mockups`
- `campaign_posts_confirmed_from_mockups` (count)
- `post_group_languages_set` (languages per slot)

Key funnel metrics:
- Product Mockups visitors → `mockup_generated`
- `mockup_generated` → `mockup_selected_for_campaign`
- `mockup_selected_for_campaign` → `ad_campaign_draft_created_from_mockups`
- `ad_campaign_draft_created_from_mockups` → at least 3 posts confirmed
- Users who complete one mockup-derived campaign → create another campaign within 30 days

Target outcome: make **"mockup → campaign"** a standard, low-friction path so that Product Mockups becomes a reliable entry point into planner + scheduler, especially for ecommerce and SaaS users working in multiple languages.
