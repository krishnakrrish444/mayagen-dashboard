# Growth & Acquisition Strategy - mayagen.ai

**Date:** 2026-02-12
**Role:** Growth Hacker
**Objective:** Optimize acquisition, conversion, and virality for the new SEO landing pages.

---

## 1. Acquisition Funnel Design: The "Instant Gratification" Flow

**Entry Point:** SEO Landing Page (e.g., `/ai-meme-generator`)
**Target Audience:** High-intent users searching for specific solutions (e.g., "create ai memes", "funny meme maker").

**The Strategy:** Reduce time-to-value (TTV) to near zero. Users shouldn't have to sign up to *see* the magic, only to *claim* it.

### The Flow Stages

1.  **Awareness (Search/Click):**
    *   User searches "AI meme generator".
    *   Clicks result leading to `/ai-meme-generator`.

2.  **Activation (The "Aha!" Moment):**
    *   **Hero Section:** Immediate input field: "Describe a meme..." (No generic "Sign up free" CTA).
    *   **Action:** User types prompt and clicks "Generate".
    *   **Experience:**
        *   System generates 4 low-res or watermarked previews *instantly* (or within seconds).
        *   User laughs/engages with the content immediately.

3.  **Conversion (The Gate):**
    *   **Trigger:** User clicks "Download", "Edit", or "Generate High Res".
    *   **The Hook:** "Sign up to save this meme and generate 5 more for free."
    *   **Friction Reducer:** One-click Google/social login ("Continue with Google").

4.  **Retention (Onboarding):**
    *   Post-signup redirect *back* to their generated meme (state preservation is critical).
    *   Tooltip tour: "Here's how to customize text/caption."

## 2. CRO Experiments (Conversion Rate Optimization)

These experiments will be run on the `/ai-meme-generator` landing page using A/B testing.

| Experiment Name | Hypothesis | Variant A (Control) | Variant B (Test) | Metric to Watch |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **"Greedy" vs. "Generous" Generator** | Letting users play before paying/registering increases trust and commitment. | "Sign up to generate memes" (Gate at start). | "Try it free" input field. Gate appears *after* generation. | Signup Conversion Rate |
| **Social Proof Injection** | Seeing others' success reduces skepticism about AI quality. | Standard hero image of the tool interface. | Hero section features a ticker of "Memes generated in the last hour" with user avatars. | Time on Page / Bounce Rate |
| **The "Magic Button" Copy** | "Generate" is technical; "Make me laugh" is emotional. | CTA Button: "Generate Meme" | CTA Button: "Make it Viral" or "Roast Me" | CTR (Click Through Rate) |
| **Sticky Input** | Users scroll to read features but lose the input field. | Input field stays in Hero section. | Input field becomes a sticky bar at the top/bottom as user scrolls. | Engagement Rate |

## 3. Viral Loop Mechanism: "The Watermark Removal" Loop

**Concept:** Leverage the user's desire for clean, professional content to drive referrals.

**The "Unlock Pro" Loop:**

1.  **The Incentive:**
    *   Free users get memes with a small "mayagen.ai" watermark.
    *   Pro features (Watermark removal, 4K download, Custom faces) are locked.

2.  **The Ask (The Loop):**
    *   **Option A:** Upgrade to Pro ($X/month).
    *   **Option B (Viral):** "Remove watermark on this meme for free by inviting 1 friend." OR "Unlock 24h of Pro features by inviting 2 friends."

3.  **The Mechanism:**
    *   User clicks "Unlock with Friends".
    *   Copies a unique referral link.
    *   Friend clicks link -> Lands on homepage (attributed).
    *   Friend signs up -> Original user gets notification: "Pro unlocked for 24h!"

4.  **Viral Coefficient Boosters:**
    *   **Double-Sided Reward:** The *invited* friend also gets 10 extra credits for signing up via the link.
    *   **Gamification:** "You are 1 invite away from unlocking the 'Deep Fried' filter."
