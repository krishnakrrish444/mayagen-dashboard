# Meme Generator Landing Page — Copy & SEO-Aligned Structure v2

**URL:** `/meme-generator/`  
**Owner:** @content-lead (Loki)  
**Inputs:** SEO Architecture v2, Growth Strategy v2, Meme Landing v1 copy, SEO Structure v1

---

## 1. Page Goal & Narrative

**Primary job:** Rank for high‑intent "meme generator" terms and convert visitors into:
1. First meme created (no signup).
2. First click on **"Use in social post"**.
3. First scheduled post in the Mayagen planner/scheduler.

**Narrative:**
- Visitors arrive expecting a **free meme tool**. We deliver that in seconds.  
- Then we reveal the real win: turning that meme into a **planned, multilingual campaign** across channels using Mayagen's suite (create → plan → schedule) in 100+ languages.

Tone: fast, clear, anti-fluff, suite-first but not overwhelming. Make 100+ languages and scheduler feel like power, not complexity.

## 3. H2 Sections & Copy (Merged With SEO Structure)

### H2 #1 — Create Memes in Seconds With AI

Short intro:
> Turn any idea into a meme in a few clicks. Start from classic formats or your own image, then let AI suggest captions that actually fit the joke.

Key points (body + bullets):
- Mention classic templates **by name**: *Distracted Boyfriend, Drake Hotline Bling, Change My Mind*, and more.
- Support **upload your own image** and **text‑only memes**.
- AI suggestions from a short topic or prompt (e.g., "B2B SaaS pain", "founder life", "Monday standup").

Suggested bullet list:
- **Pick a format or upload your image.** Start from classic meme templates or anything from your camera roll.
- **Describe the joke in one line.** Give Nano Banana Pro a topic, situation, or punchline.
- **Get caption ideas instantly.** Choose from AI‑suggested top and bottom text, or write your own.

Add a 3–4 step **How it works** block for `HowTo` schema, with steps like:
1. Choose a meme template or upload your own image.  
2. Enter a topic or line you want the meme to be about.  
3. Pick an AI‑suggested caption and tweak the layout.  
4. Click **"Use in social post"** to publish it, or download your meme.

Internal links (inline):
- Link phrase "AI meme generator" or "meme generator for social media" as appropriate (no extra routes needed here).

### H2 #2 — Turn Your Meme Into a Social Post (In One Click)

This is the funnel hinge. Copy must make **"Use in social post"** the obvious next step after creation.

Intro paragraph:
> Most meme generators stop at the download button. Mayagen takes you one step further: click **"Use in social post"** and turn your meme into a ready‑to‑schedule post with captions, hashtags, and a publish time.

Key points:
- "Use in social post" is the **primary** action after generation.  
- Download (with watermark) is secondary.
- Show a **mini composer**: pick channel, see suggested caption, choose date/time.

Feature bullets:
- **One click from meme to post.** Hit **"Use in social post"** to open a focused composer with your meme already attached.
- **Channel‑aware captions.** Get caption suggestions tuned for Instagram, X, LinkedIn, and more — not one generic line pasted everywhere.
- **Schedule without leaving the page.** Pick a time and confirm; your post appears in the Mayagen scheduler.

Inline note for design:
> Show the meme editor with a prominent "Use in social post" button. On click, slide in a right‑hand panel with network selector, caption field, and a simple date/time picker.

Internal links:
- "Create social media posts" → `/social-media-posts/`  
- "social media scheduler" → `/social-media-scheduler/`

CTA in-section: **Plan a post with this meme →** (scrolls to planner section or opens planner with meme pre‑loaded, depending on app routing).

---

### H2 #3 — Plan Meme Campaigns, Not One‑Off Posts

Narrative: tie memes into **planner** and **content calendar**, aligning with Growth v2.

Intro paragraph:
> The best memes don’t live and die in your downloads folder. Drop them straight into your content planner, mix them with your regular posts, and see how they line up across the week.

Body copy ideas:
- Explain that memes become building blocks inside campaigns/boards.
- Mention that users can see memes alongside carousels, product mockups, and logo‑led posts.

Bullets:
- **See memes in your weekly calendar.** Place memes across days and channels to avoid spamming or going quiet for weeks.
- **Combine memes with “serious” posts.** Use memes to open a conversation, then follow up with product posts, case studies, or offers.
- **Reuse winning memes.** Duplicate successful memes and adjust dates, channels, or languages in a couple of clicks.

Internal links:
- "social content planner" → `/social-content-planner/`  
- "content calendar" → `/content-calendar/`

Design note:
> Show a weekly planner with 2–3 meme thumbnails interleaved with other post types. Include a pull‑quote or stat if available later (e.g., "Teams that plan memes in a calendar publish 3× more consistently").

### H2 #4 — Memes in 100+ Languages With Nano Banana Pro

This section makes the multilingual angle a hero without overwhelming the user.

Intro paragraph:
> One meme idea can work in every market — if the joke still lands. Nano Banana Pro helps you adapt your meme captions into 100+ languages so they read like a local wrote them, not a translation engine.

Key copy elements:
- Emphasize **localization**, not raw translation.
- Make it clear that users stay in control and can edit any line.

Bullets / microcopy:
- **Localize the joke, not just the words.** We adjust references, tone, and phrasing so the punchline still makes sense.
- **Pick languages per campaign.** Choose which markets to include; we generate variants only where you plan to post.
- **Review every caption before it goes live.** Tweak any line; Nano Banana Pro learns from your edits.

Design example: side‑by‑side memes (EN + 2 other languages) with slightly different phrasing.

Internal link:
- "multilingual social posts" → `/multilingual-social-posts/`

### H2 #5 — Why Teams Start With Memes (and Stay for the Suite)

Bridge into the full Mayagen story: memes as **entry point** to the AI creative suite.

Intro paragraph:
> Meme Generator is free and fast, but it’s only the start. When you’re ready to move from one‑off jokes to a consistent brand presence, Mayagen connects your memes to logos, brand kits, templates, and a full social media scheduler.

Three columns / feature groupings:
- **On‑brand by default**  
  "Plug in your logo, colors, and fonts once, and Meme Generator will pull from your Mayagen brand kit so every meme feels like you."

- **Works with your other assets**  
  "Reuse memes in carousels, ads, and templates — right alongside product mockups and other graphics."

- **Part of the full AI creative suite**  
  "From Logo Maker to Brand Kit, from Product Mockups to the Social Media Scheduler, Mayagen gives you one workspace to create, plan, and ship content."

Internal links:
- `/suite/` — "Mayagen AI creative suite"  
- `/logo-maker/` — "Logo Maker"  
- `/brand-kit/` — "brand kit"  
- `/product-mockups/` — (optional) "product mockups" if mentioned.

### H2 #6 — Examples of Meme‑Led Campaigns

Goal: show concrete flows from meme → planner → scheduler, aligned with Growth v2.

Intro paragraph:
> Whether you run a SaaS product, an ecommerce store, or a community, memes can be more than throwaway posts. Here’s how teams turn a single meme idea into full campaigns.

Example cards (3):
1. **B2B SaaS launch**  
   "Start with a founder‑life meme on LinkedIn, then follow up with product screenshots and case‑study posts across the week. Plan and schedule the entire launch in Mayagen."

2. **Ecommerce drop**  
   "Announce a new collection with memes, then move into product mockups, carousels, and last‑chance reminders. Keep everything in one calendar."

3. **Community engagement series**  
   "Run a weekly meme + question format to keep Discord or Slack active, with posts scheduled across channels in advance."

Each card should include a soft CTA like: **"View this as a calendar"** that deep‑links to a demo planner view if available.

Internal links: optional blog posts once created (e.g., "From Meme to Marketing Campaign" article).
