# Weekly Content Pack Experiment — Email & In‑App Sequence v2

Goal: Drive a repeatable habit around the Mayagen suite — **create → plan → schedule** — using Weekly Content Packs as the spine, and make 100+ languages feel like a small, optional reach upgrade (1–3 extra languages, grouped variants) instead of calendar chaos.

This v2 refines v1 into segment‑specific flows and implementation‑ready blocks. All variants share:
- Clear suite framing: content packs are pre‑assembled ways to **create**, drop into the **planner**, and **schedule** a week of posts.
- Multilingual as optional: “add 1–3 extra languages” with grouped variants; calendar stays tidy.
- Concrete outcomes: “a week of posts scheduled”, “launch week ready”, “next campaign on the calendar,” not abstract AI magic.

Segments:
1. New / low‑activity users
2. Inconsistent users (some usage, weak habit)
3. Power users (regular planner/scheduler usage)

>
> You stay in control: edit any post, drop what doesn’t fit, and add more where you need it.

## Shared Notes for Implementation

- All surfaces (email, dashboard, planner hints, pack detail views) must use the same core spine: **create → plan → schedule**.
- When mentioning multiple languages, always:
  - Emphasize "1–3" extra languages.
  - Mention grouped variants and a tidy calendar.
  - Frame it as optional reach, not required setup.
- Where possible, link directly into:
  - Pack detail view (with a 7‑day preview in planner).
  - A simplified “this week” planner scope for new/inconsistent users.
  - Campaign or segment‑specific views for power users.
- Keep CTAs concrete and outcome‑oriented: open pack, finish week, add languages, load into planner.
