# Weekly Content Pack — Email & In‑App Sequence v1

Goal: Reinforce the Mayagen suite spine — **create → plan → schedule** — and make 100+ languages feel like an optional reach upgrade (1–3 extra languages, grouped variants) rather than complexity. This sequence pairs lifecycle emails with in‑app surfaces.

## Audience Segments

1. **New or lightly activated users**
   - Have created 0–3 assets; few or no scheduled posts.
   - Primary outcome: help them publish their *first* scheduled week.

2. **Inconsistent posters**
   - Have assets and some scheduled posts, but long gaps.
   - Primary outcome: give them an easy way to restart with a pre‑built week.

3. **Power users**
   - Regularly schedule; often in multiple languages.
   - Primary outcome: turn Packs into a time‑saver and testing tool.

## Email 1 — Announce Weekly Content Packs (All Segments)

**Subject options**
- "Your next 7 days of posts. Pre‑built."
- "Stop staring at a blank calendar — try a Weekly Content Pack"
- "Create, plan, schedule a full week in minutes"

**Preview text**
- "Memes, posts, and mockups shaped to your brand — ready to schedule in a few clicks."

**Body (base version)**

Hi {{first_name}},

Keeping a content calendar full is hard. Mayagen’s new **Weekly Content Packs** make it feel small.

Each pack gives you:

- **Ready‑to‑edit posts** based on your brand and goals
- **Suggested images and memes** pulled from Mayagen’s generators
- A simple path to **create → plan → schedule** a full week in one place

If you work in more than one language, you can add **1–3 extra languages** with grouped variants — so your calendar stays tidy while your reach grows.

**How it works**
1. Answer a few questions about your brand and this week’s focus.
2. Mayagen creates a pack of posts, images, and prompts.
3. You review, tweak, and **schedule the full week** from the planner.

Open Mayagen to try your first pack:

> **[Generate this week’s Content Pack]**

We’ll start simple: one week, one plan, with optional extra languages. You can always edit or skip anything that doesn’t fit.

Best,
The Mayagen team

## Email 2 — Nudge to Use the Planner (New / Inconsistent Users)

**Trigger**: User generated a pack but has scheduled 0–2 posts from it after 24–48 hours.

**Subject options**
- "Your pack is waiting in the planner"
- "You’re 3 clicks away from a full week of posts"

**Preview text**
- "You already have the ideas. Let’s put them on the calendar."

**Body**

Hi {{first_name}},

You’ve already generated a **Weekly Content Pack** — that’s the hard part.

Next step: put it to work.

Inside your planner, you’ll see:

- A pre‑filled week of posts from your pack
- Suggested times for each channel
- A single flow to **review → adjust → schedule**

If you want to reach more markets, you can add **up to 3 extra languages**. Mayagen creates language variants and groups them under each base post, so your calendar doesn’t explode with duplicates.

> **[Open planner and schedule this week]**

Give yourself a week of consistency in a few minutes.

Best,
The Mayagen team

## Email 3 — Power User / Multilingual Upgrade

**Trigger**: User regularly schedules posts but has not used Packs, or uses Packs in one language only.

**Subject options**
- "Turn one plan into three markets"
- "Reuse your best weeks in new languages"

**Preview text**
- "Duplicate a strong week into 1–3 more languages without rebuilding."

**Body**

Hi {{first_name}},

You’re already using Mayagen’s planner and scheduler. **Weekly Content Packs** help you go further without adding work.

Here’s what changes when you turn Packs on:

- Start from a **pre‑built week** tuned to your goals
- Save your best weeks as templates you can reuse
- Add **1–3 extra languages** as grouped variants, not separate calendars

From your planner you can:

1. Pick a Pack that matches your goal (launch, evergreen, promo week).
2. Edit the base posts.
3. Add languages where it makes sense — Mayagen suggests and groups them for you.
4. **Schedule the full week** in one flow.

> **[Try a Weekly Content Pack with your next campaign]**

You get the reach of 100+ languages, but you only manage one plan.

Best,
The Mayagen team

## Notes for Implementation

- Keep the phrase **"create → plan → schedule"** consistent across email and in‑app copy.
- When referencing languages, use soft numbers: **"1–3 extra languages"** and **"100+ languages"** for the overall capability.
- Group language variants visually under a single base post to match the promise of "reach, not complexity."
