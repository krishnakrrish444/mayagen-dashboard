# Mayagen.ai Content & Messaging – v2

## 1) High-level homepage messaging

### Hero
Create, plan, and schedule multilingual content from one AI-native workspace.

### Sub-hero
Mayagen is more than an image generator. Design on-brand visuals, plan campaigns, and auto-schedule posts across markets—powered by Nano Banana Pro for fluent, culturally aware content in dozens of languages.

### 3–5 Key Value Bullets

- **All-in-one creative suite** – Go from idea → design → scheduled post without hopping tools. Graphics, planners, and schedulers live in a single, AI-coordinated workspace.
- **Multilingual by design** – Generate memes, ads, and graphics that actually read natively in each market, with Nano Banana Pro handling tone, slang, and cultural nuance.
- **From assets to outcomes** – Turn creatives into campaigns: attach each design to channels, audiences, and dates so every image has a clear job to do.
- **Team-ready workflows** – Templates, shared brand kits, and approvals keep designers, marketers, and social teams aligned and on-message.
- **Schedule once, adapt everywhere** – Plan a campaign once and auto-adapt copy, visuals, and timings per platform, per language, in a few clicks.

## 2) Content pillars for blog/docs

### Pillar 1: Multilingual Social & Campaigns
Focus: How to plan, create, and localize social content and campaigns across regions without fragmenting workflows.

Example angles:
- Playbooks for launching a campaign in 5+ languages from a single brief
- Balancing brand consistency with local voice and humor
- Avoiding common translation and cultural-fit mistakes

### Pillar 2: Full-Funnel Creative Workflows
Focus: Connecting top-of-funnel visuals (memes, social posts) to deeper-funnel assets (product mockups, landing graphics) inside one system.

Example angles:
- Mapping creatives to funnel stages and KPIs inside Mayagen
- Turning one concept into a meme, ad set, email header, and product shot
- Workflow patterns for performance marketers and growth teams

### Pillar 3: Brand Systems & Consistency at Scale
Focus: Using Mayagen to protect and scale brand identity while producing a high volume of creative.

Example angles:
- Building and enforcing brand kits across logos, product shots, and templates
- Collaborating across design, marketing, and regional teams
- Governance: approvals, versioning, and asset libraries

### Pillar 4: Time-Saving Automation for Creators & Teams
Focus: Automation and scheduling that turn creative work into repeatable systems.

Example angles:
- Weekly content rituals: from idea backlog to scheduled calendar
- Using planners and schedulers together with graphics tools
- Case studies on hours saved and output gained

### Pillar 5: Use-Case Deep Dives (Meme, Logo, Product Mockups & more)
Focus: Showcasing how individual tools shine as part of the broader suite, not as isolated generators.

Example angles:
- Series: “From Meme to Campaign” – expanding a meme into a full social sequence
- Series: “From Logo to Launch Kit” – using the Logo Designer as the starting point for an entire brand rollout
- Tutorials that chain tools together (e.g., logo → social kit → product mockups → scheduled launch)

## 3) Flagship tool pages – updated copy structures

Each tool page should clearly position the tool as a node in the broader Mayagen workflow (create → plan → schedule, single workspace, multilingual).

### 3.1 Meme Generator – Page Copy Structure

**Page title**
Meme Generator – Turn ideas into multilingual, campaign-ready memes.

**Above-the-fold sub-heading**
Create on-brand memes in minutes, then plug them straight into your content calendar—localized for every market you care about.

**Problem framing (section)**
- Memes work, but scaling them is hard: they’re time-sensitive, language-specific, and easy to get wrong culturally.
- Most meme tools stop at the image. Mayagen connects memes to campaigns, audiences, and schedules.

**Value section: "Meme creation that lives inside your workflow"**
- **Instant concepts, on-brand visuals** – Describe the joke or angle; Mayagen suggests formats, captions, and layouts that match your brand kit.
- **Multilingual humor, not just translation** – Nano Banana Pro adapts tone and references so memes feel native in each language.
- **From meme to scheduled post** – Drop memes directly onto your planner, assign channels, and schedule in one click.
- **Test variations easily** – Spin out A/B versions for different audiences and track which formats perform.

**How it fits into the suite (section)**
Short narrative tying Meme Generator to planners/schedulers and other tools, e.g.:
- Start with a meme concept in the Meme Generator.
- Auto-generate localized variants for each region.
- Add them to a weekly meme slot in your social planner.
- Extend the top performer into ad creatives and email banners.

**Key features (bulleted)**
- Template-aware layouts and brand kits
- Caption suggestions in multiple languages
- Direct send to planner/scheduler
- Version history and approvals for teams

**CTA**
“Create your first campaign-ready meme” – emphasizing that it’s part of a campaign, not just a one-off image.

### 3.2 Logo Designer – Page Copy Structure

**Page title**
Logo Designer – Design your brand, then roll it out everywhere.

**Above-the-fold sub-heading**
Craft a logo, define your visual system, and instantly generate the core assets you need—from social avatars to product shots—within the same workspace.

**Problem framing (section)**
- Logos often get designed in isolation, leaving teams to manually create the rest of the brand system.
- Mayagen’s Logo Designer is connected to templates, brand kits, and schedulers, so your logo becomes a living system from day one.

**Value section: "From logo concept to complete brand kit"**
- **AI-assisted exploration** – Rapidly explore directions based on your name, values, and industry, with smart guidance instead of random noise.
- **Auto-built brand kit** – Colors, typography, usage rules, and social-safe variants created from your chosen logo.
- **Instant content-ready assets** – Generate profile images, cover photos, email headers, and launch graphics in one place.
- **Multilingual-ready branding** – Create lockups and taglines in multiple languages so your brand launches globally, not just locally.

**How it fits into the suite (section)**
- Start with the Logo Designer to establish your visual identity.
- Push your new brand kit into templates used by Meme Generator, Product Mockups, and social graphics.
- Use the planner and scheduler to roll out a coordinated brand launch across channels and regions.

**Key features (bulleted)**
- Interactive AI logo concepts and refinements
- One-click brand kit generation
- Automatic template updates across the suite
- Multi-language name/tagline exploration

**CTA**
“Design a logo and launch your brand kit” – framing the outcome as a full launch, not just a file.

### 3.3 Product Mockups – Page Copy Structure

**Page title**
Product Mockups – On-brand visuals linked to real campaigns.

**Above-the-fold sub-heading**
Generate realistic, on-brand product shots and plug them straight into ads, landing pages, and scheduled launches.

**Problem framing (section)**
- Isolated mockup tools create pretty images that then have to be manually organized and repurposed.
- With Mayagen, product visuals are directly tied to campaigns, audiences, and dates from the moment they’re created.

**Value section: "From mockup to market"**
- **Consistent, on-brand visuals** – Product shots automatically inherit your brand kit: colors, lighting styles, and graphic accents stay consistent.
- **Channel-specific variants** – Generate the right crops and compositions for ads, social, marketplaces, and websites in one flow.
- **Multilingual packaging & overlays** – Instantly adapt labels, captions, and text overlays for each language and region.
- **Attach to campaigns and funnels** – Assign mockups to launch campaigns, promos, and nurture sequences inside Mayagen.

**How it fits into the suite (section)**
- Pull in your brand kit from the Logo Designer.
- Generate a series of product mockups for an upcoming launch.
- Insert them into ad templates, email headers, and landing sections.
- Schedule the entire launch using planners and schedulers, with localized variants per market.

**Key features (bulleted)**
- Brand-aware mockup generation
- Pre-sized templates for major channels
- Text and label localization via Nano Banana Pro
- Asset library with campaign tagging

**CTA**
“Create product visuals that are ready to launch” – emphasizing that assets are immediately usable in campaigns.

This v2 messaging positions Mayagen clearly as an integrated creative + planning + scheduling suite, with each flagship tool contributing to a connected, multilingual workflow rather than standing alone as a point solution.
