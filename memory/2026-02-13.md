## Mayagen Mission Control Setup
- SK wants a multi-agent "Mission Control" style system for Mayagen, inspired by the pbteja1998 article.
- I set up a basic file-based Mission Control under `mayagen/`:
  - `mayagen/tasks/INBOX.md`, `ACTIVE.md`, `DONE.md` with initial 5 tasks
  - `mayagen/agents/seo-growth/SOUL.md` (Vision), `content-lead/SOUL.md` (Loki), `product-ux/SOUL.md` (Shuri)
  - `mayagen/agents/README.md` describing the initial roster
  - `mayagen/AGENTS-MISSION-CONTROL.md` documenting coordinator duties and agent behavior
- Goal: let specialist agents wake on heartbeats, pick tasks, and work on Mayagen continuously.

## Model / Infra
- Model is now `openai/gpt-5.1` using SK's project key.
- Browser control still not available on this host; I explained that Browser Relay on a local machine or GUI VPS is needed for real interactive browsing.

## v2 Strategy Reports
- All v2 reports for Mayagen are completed and saved:
  - `product-strategy-v2.md`: positions Mayagen as an "AI visual & social command center" with 12‑month roadmap.
  - `seo-audit-v2.md`: suite-first IA for 45+ tools, 10 flagship pages, Next.js SEO setup, 90‑day plan.
  - `growth-strategy-v2.md`: funnels + growth loops using free tools, gallery, scheduler.
  - `content-strategy-v2.md`: new homepage messaging, content pillars, flagship tool copy structures.
  - `analytics-plan-v2.md`: workflow-first tracking (tool → planner → scheduler → publish) with north star metrics and PostHog dashboards.
